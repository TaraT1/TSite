# TSite
TSite is a git repo of TaraThierry.com, my personal website, which focuses on intermedia portfolio and professional evolving and history.

The site is a learning opportunity and experimentation building with html, css, javascript, and php, eventually integrating framework(s) that increase efficiencies and lessen the pain points.

Soon to come are intermedia experiments using clojurescript dependent tools.
